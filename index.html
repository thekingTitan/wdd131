            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Emmanuel, but my friends call me Titan. I am passionate about 
                music and technology, two fields that have shaped my journey in life. Growing up, 
                I dreamed of becoming a musician, as music has always been a powerful source of joy 
                and inspiration for me. Even today, I enjoy exploring different genres, creating melodies, 
                and appreciating the artistry behind great compositions.
                However, as I matured, I discovered another love: coding. The logical challenges and 
                creativity involved in solving problems through programming captured my heart. Over time, 
                my passion for coding surpassed my love for music, leading me to pursue it as a career. 
                It brings me immense satisfaction to write code, build solutions, and tackle complex tasks with innovative approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not immersed in coding or enjoying music, you’ll likely 
                find me savoring my favorite meal: jollof rice with a side of fresh salads. 
                Problem-solving has always been a natural strength of mine, helping me excel 
                in subjects like mathematics during my school years.
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Today, I’m focused on learning and growing in the field of web development, blending 
                    creativity with technical skills to create dynamic and impactful solutions. My journey
                     reflects my belief that passion and perseverance can turn dreams into reality. Whether 
                     through music or technology, I strive to leave a lasting mark on the world.

            <h3>Lagos, Nigeria</h3>
            <div class="second-paragraph">
                <p>
                    Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, is a vibrant metropolis known for its rich history, cultural 
                    diversity, and economic significance. Founded in 1452 and named by Portuguese explorers, Lagos has 
                    evolved into Africa's economic powerhouse and innovation hub, contributing 25% of Nigeria’s GDP. It’s 
                    the birthplace of Afrobeats and home to iconic landmarks like the Third Mainland Bridge and the NECOM
                     House. Lagos boasts a dynamic food scene with staples like Jollof rice and Suya, while its festivals 
                     celebrate creativity and tradition. Despite its challenges, the energy and resilience of Lagosians 
                     make the city a true symbol of African excellence.
